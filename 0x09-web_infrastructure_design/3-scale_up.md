## Whiteboard Breakdown: Scalable and Highly Available Web Infrastructure for foobar.com [invalid URL removed]

This design builds upon the previous one, focusing on high availability and increased scalability by splitting components and introducing a clustered load balancer.

**Components:**

1. **Load Balancers (HAproxy - Clustered):** We now have two HAproxy servers configured as a cluster. This provides redundancy for the load balancing function. If one HAproxy fails, the other takes over, ensuring continuous traffic distribution.

2. **Web Server (Nginx - Dedicated Server):** A dedicated server runs Nginx and terminates SSL/TLS encryption for HTTPS traffic.

3. **Application Server (Dedicated Server):** This server focuses on processing dynamic website content, separated from the web server for better resource allocation.

4. **Database Server (MySQL):** A dedicated server runs MySQL, further improving security and performance by isolating database workloads.

5. **Monitoring Clients:**  Each server runs a monitoring client for comprehensive data collection.

6. **Monitoring Service (e.g., Sumologic):** The external service remains for centralized data analysis and alerting.

**Explanation:**

**Increased Scalability:**

* **Split Components:** Separating web servers, application servers, and databases allows independent scaling. You can add more web servers behind the load balancer to handle increased traffic. Similarly, scaling the application server or database server can address specific resource bottlenecks.

**High Availability:**

* **Clustered Load Balancers:** The HAproxy cluster ensures continuous traffic distribution even if one load balancer fails.

**Improved Security:**

* **Separation of Concerns:** Isolating components on dedicated servers minimizes the attack surface and improves overall security.

**Why Add Each Element:**

* **Clustered Load Balancers:** Redundancy ensures continuous traffic flow even during load balancer failures.
* **Dedicated Web Server:**  Improves performance and security by focusing on web serving tasks.
* **Dedicated Application Server:** Optimizes resource allocation by isolating application processing.
* **Dedicated Database Server:**  Enhances security and database performance by separating database workloads.

**Limitations:**

* **Complexity:** Managing multiple servers increases infrastructure complexity.
* **Cost:** Additional servers require more resources and potentially higher operational costs.

**Next Steps:**

* Consider containerization technologies like Docker for easier application deployment and scaling.
* Explore database clustering solutions like Galera cluster for improved database write availability.
