Postmortem: Compatibility Issues Causing Web App Outage

Issue Summary
On June 6, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM UTC, our food ordering web app experienced an outage due to compatibility issues introduced by a new update. This resulted in 80% of users being unable to access the app, while the remaining 20% experienced significant slowdowns. The root cause was identified as compatibility problems between the new update and our existing database schema.

Timeline
- **10:00 AM** - Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating a sudden drop in app performance.
- **10:05 AM** - Engineers began investigating the app servers and network infrastructure.
- **10:20 AM** - Initial assumption was a network issue, but no faults were found.
- **10:35 AM** - Escalated to the database team for further investigation.
- **10:45 AM** - Database team identified schema mismatches caused by the recent update.
- **11:00 AM** - Misleading paths included checking server load and firewall settings.
- **11:15 AM** - Incident escalated to the software development team.
- **11:30 AM** - Development team updated the source code to handle the new schema.
- **12:00 PM** - Full service restored and verified.

Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the issue was a recent software update that included changes incompatible with the current database schema. Specifically, the update introduced new fields and data types that were not supported by the existing application code, causing queries to fail and the app to become unresponsive.

The issue was resolved by updating the application code to handle the new database schema correctly. This involved:
1. Identifying the exact changes introduced by the update.
2. Modifying the application code to match the updated schema, including changes to query structures, data handling, and validation logic.
3. Deploying the updated application code.
4. Monitoring the system to ensure the issue was fully resolved.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar issues in the future, the following improvements and tasks have been identified:

1. **Improvement Areas**:
   - Implement more robust testing procedures for updates, particularly focusing on compatibility with existing systems.
   - Enhance monitoring tools to detect compatibility issues more quickly.
   - Develop a faster deployment and update procedure to minimize downtime during similar incidents.

2. **Tasks**:
   - **Task 1**: Implement comprehensive integration tests for all updates, including database schema changes and application code compatibility.
   - **Task 2**: Add monitoring alerts for database query failures and schema mismatches.
   - **Task 3**: Train the engineering team on quick update procedures and ensure all necessary scripts are ready for deployment.
   - **Task 4**: Schedule regular review meetings to assess and update our testing and deployment processes.
   - **Task 5**: Document the incident and the steps taken for future reference and training purposes.

By implementing these measures, we aim to enhance the stability and reliability of our web app, ensuring a smoother user experience even during updates.
